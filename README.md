# Project Euler Problems in NodeJS

My stab at implementing the Project Euler problems from
https://projecteuler.net/

A Docker workflow is present for build and running of the project.
Should dependencies change in the `package.json` you will need to
rebuild the project

### Build

```sh
./build
```

### Run

```sh
./run <problem>
```
